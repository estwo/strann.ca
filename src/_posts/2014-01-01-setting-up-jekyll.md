Setting up Jekyll was a fairly pleasant experience, I did run into some issues with the blackhole that is Jekyll's error logging but other than that it was a snap to get setup. Github pages are fantastic so far, it didn't make sense to continue paying $120/yr for hosting a simple personal site when I can generate a static site with Jekyll, push it to Github and boom its automatically updated. The Github config was very easy as well, just a matter of having the correct branch name (gh-pages), a CNAME file with my domain and setting up some dns records to point to the right Github IP.

So thats that, I now have a platform to build on... more to come.
